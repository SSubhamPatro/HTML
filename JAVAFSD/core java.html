<h3><u>What is java</u></h3> 
   <p>
    Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.
    
    Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.
    
    Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.

    <h3><u>History of Java</u></h3>
    
<p>The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java starts with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was best suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.

The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic". Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling and his team members started the project in the early '90s.

James Gosling - founder of java
Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, etc. Following are given significant points that describe the history of Java.</p>
<ul>
<ul> 

<li>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called Green Team.</li>

<li>Initially it was designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes.</li>

<li>Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling, and the file extension was .gt. </li>

<li>After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project.</li>

</ul> 
</ul>

<h3><u>Difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li><u>JVM</u>
    


<p>JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist. It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.
JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms. JVM, JRE, and JDK are platform dependent because the configuration of each OS is different from each other. However, Java is platform independent. There are three notions of the JVM: specification, implementation, and instance.</p>

<ul>
<li>The JVM performs the following main tasks:</li>

<ul>
<li>Loads code</li>
<li>Verifies code</li>
<li>Executes code</li>
<li>Provides runtime environment</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>


<li><u>JRE</u>
<ul>
        


<li>JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment. It is also written as Java RTE. The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.</li>

<li>The implementation of JVM is also actively released by other companies besides Sun Micro Systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><u>JDK</u></li>

<p>JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets. It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools.</li>
JDK is an implementation of any one of the below given Java Platforms released by Oracle Corporation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard Edition Java Platform</li>
<li>Enterprise Edition Java Platform</li>
<li>Micro Edition Java Platform</li>
</ul>

<p>The JDK contains a private Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a few other resources such as an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), etc. to complete the development of a Java Application.</p>

</ul>

<h3><u>Java Variables</u></h3>

<p>A variable is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed. A variable is assigned with a data type.
Variable is a name of memory location. There are three types of variables in java: local, instance and static.
There are two types of data types in Java: primitive and non-primitive.</p>
<hr>

<h4><u>Variable</u></h4>
<p>A variable is the name of a reserved area allocated in memory. In other words, it is a name of the memory location. It is a combination of "vary + able" which means its value can be changed.</p>
<ul>
<li>variables in java</li>
int data=50;//Here data is variable  
</ul>

<h4><u>Types of Variables</u></h4>
<p>There are three types of variables in Java:</p>
<ul>
<li>local variable</li>
<li>instance variable</li>
<li>static variable</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><u>Local Variable</u>

<ul>
<li>A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable. You can use this variable only within that method and the other methods in the class aren't even aware that the variable exists.</li>
<li>A local variable cannot be defined with "static" keyword.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<Li><u>Instance Variable</u>
<ul>
<li>A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, is called an instance variable. It is not declared as static.</li>

<li>It is called an instance variable because its value is instance-specific and is not shared among instances.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><u>Static variable</u></li>

<p>A variable that is declared as static is called a static variable. It cannot be local. You can create a single copy of the static variable and share it among all the instances of the class. 
Memory allocation for static variables happens only once when the class is loaded in the memory.</p>
</ul>
