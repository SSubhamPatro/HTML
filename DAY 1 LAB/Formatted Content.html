    <h1>Formatted Content with Paragraphs and rules</h1>
    <h4>
      This is the first paragraph of the content. It provides an introduction to
      the topic being discussed. The paragraph is formatted with proper
      indentation and spacing to ensure readability and a clean layout.
    </h4>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This is the second paragraph. It includes a line break,<br />
      which is used to break the content onto a new line without starting a new
      paragraph.<br />
      This is useful for creating a list or emphasizing separate points within
      the same paragraph.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This third paragraph follows the second paragraph. It contains more
      information on the topic,<br />
      and uses line breaks to structure the content<br />
      into clear, readable sections.
    </p>

    <hr />
    <p>
      This final paragraph concludes the content.<br />
      It summarizes the key points discussed above<br />
      and provides a closing statement. Proper formatting, including the use of
      rules and line breaks, ensures that the content is easy to follow and
      visually appealing.
