    <h1>Quotation and Citation Tags in HTML</h1>
    <p>Here is a famous quote by Albert Einstein:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <q
        >Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep
        moving.</q
      >
    </blockquote>

    <p>In the context of this discussion, one might say:</p>

    <p><q>To keep your balance, you must keep moving.</q></p>

    <p>This quote is widely attributed to <cite> Einstein.</cite></p>

    <p>
      In literary studies, it's essential to cite sources properly. For example,
      if you're referencing a famous work like <cite> Pride and Prejudice</cite>
    </p>
    by Jane Austen, you should always include the author's name to give proper
    credit.<br />

    <p>Another classic example can be seen in <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite></p>
    by William Shakespeare, where love and tragedy intertwine to create a
    timeless story.<br />
